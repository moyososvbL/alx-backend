Pagination is basically dividing the data into different views. Suppose there are list of 100 news data where you just want to show 10 news per page, then we will have to add and design pagination for that. You can use libraries as well.

This will improve the page speed by loading only 10 results instead of 100.

This will go like:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

It's up to you that where you wanna display it and design according to your need.
